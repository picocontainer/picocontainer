/**
 * A component adapter is responsible for providing a specific component
 * instance of type &lt;T&gt;. An instance of an implementation of this interface is
 * used inside a {@link PicoContainer} for every registered component or
 * instance. Each <code>ComponentAdapter</code> instance has to have a key
 * which is unique within that container. The key itself is either a class type
 * (normally an interface) or an identifier.
 * <p>In a overly simplistic sense, the ComponentAdapter can be thought of as a type of
 * an object factory.  If you need to modify how your object is constructed, use an appropriate
 * ComponentAdapter or roll your own since the API is purposely kept rather simple.  See

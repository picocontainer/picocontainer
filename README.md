## Status

PicoContainer 3.x is in Git at Github and Codehaus (mirrors), and is a work in progress.  

PicoContainer 3.x is good enough to use in production, but it is not finished yet.

## Goals over 2.x

The major piece that's taking a while to do is [JSR 330](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330) compatibility, and is more or less complete.

## 2.x

If you want the previous PicoContainer (2.x), it is still available on GitHub.

## Web Site

The Website for PicoContainer itself is [picocontainer.com](http://picocontainer.com)

Presently, it is for the 2.x series of releases.
